a b s t r a c t
The Swedish Civil Air Traﬃc Control (SCAT) dataset consists
of 13 weeks of data collected from the area control in Sweden ﬂight information region. The dataset consists of detailed
data from almost 170,0 0 0 ﬂights as well as airspace data and
weather forecasts. The ﬂight data includes system updated
ﬂight plans, clearances from air traﬃc control, surveillance
data and trajectory prediction data. Each week of data is continuous but the 13 weeks are spread over one year to provide variations in weather and seasonal traﬃc patterns. The
dataset does only include scheduled ﬂights not involved in
any incident reports. Sensitive data such as military and private ﬂight has been removed.
The SCAT dataset can be useful for any research related to
air traﬃc control, e.g. analysis of transportation patterns, environmental impact, optimization and automation/AI.

The dataset includes surveillance data, air traﬃc controller input, ﬂight

control.
Institution: LFV (Swedish air navigation service provider)
Country: Sweden (Swedish Flight Information Region)All the data in this
dataset originates from data recorded by the TopSky air traﬃc control system
[1], however some of the data in TopSky originates from other sources:
• Surveillance data originates from the ARTAS system [2] which is a
multi-sensor tracker, which gets its data from radar stations and wide area
multilateration sensors in Sweden.
• Weather forecasts originates from the world meteorological organization
[3] in London.
• Flight planning data originates from the ﬂight plans submitted by
pilots/airline operators in their respective countries, sent via the
aeronautical networks AFTN/AMHS to TopSky. Flight plan updates are also
sent from neighboring ﬂight information regions using the OLDI protocol.
• Airspace data mostly originates from Aeronautical Information Publications
(AIP) made in relevant countries, but alterations and addition may be done
to adapt the information to TopSky.

Data accessibility

Data that originates from these other systems may have been modiﬁed by
TopSky before being recorded.

Value of the Data
• A key challenge in the research of air traﬃc control is that there is a lack of publicly available
data [4,5]. The main reasons is that data in this domain in many cases is classiﬁed and/or rely
on proprietary software systems and data formats.
• This dataset is unique in its kind. Other publicly available sources of air traﬃc related data
exists, e.g. OpenSky Network [6] and ADS-B Exchange [7], however these sources are limited
to ADS-B data and are as such lacking the comprehensive coverage of the full information
related to each ﬂight as presented in the this data set.
• This dataset can be useful for any research related to air traﬃc and air traﬃc control, e.g.
automation and support tools for air traﬃc control, environmental research and airspace optimization.

1. Objective
There is currently a lack of high-quality open datasets for research around air traﬃc control
and air transportation. The main objective behind the SCAT dataset [8] is to enable in-depth
analysis and research in the context of aviation. We foresee that SCAT can be used in the research and development of future AI and machine learning based tools for air traﬃc control.

2. Data Description
The Swedish Civil Air Traﬃc Control (SCAT) dataset [8] contains detailed data of almost
170,0 0 0 ﬂights, weather forecasts and airspace data from a perspective of air traﬃc control. The
data originates from the air traﬃc control systems at the two control centers, Malmö (ESMM)
and Stockholm (ESOS), which provide upper area control in the Swedish ﬂight information region (FIR). The data is organized in 13 compressed archives in ZIP format, each containing one
week of continuous data, see Table 1. The data has been ﬁltered and processed as described in
the “Experimental design, materials and methods” section.
All ﬁles inside the archives are in the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format [9]. Time
stamps are in UTC time and represented as strings in ISO 8601 format without explicit time zone
(e.g. 2017-06-06T13:45:10.362). Properties without values may be null or left out, depending on
the source for the data. To reduce the number of tables needed to document each object type,
several object types may be represented in one table. In such case indentation and the sign • is
used in front of the property name to indicate that it is a property of the object at the previous
indentation level.
Each archive contains several ﬂight ﬁles, which are ﬁles named with the unique id number
given to the ﬂight during data extraction, e.g. 101234.json. Each ﬁle holds all the data related to
a single ﬂight such as:
• The sequence of control centers controlling the ﬂight.
• Data related to ﬂight planning, coordination and clearances from the air traﬃc controllers.
• Surveillance data from the system tracker which process’ the information from multiple radar
and wide area multilateration sources into a single traﬃc view.
• Data from the trajectory prediction subsystem in TopSky which repeatedly makes updated
predictions of the future ﬂight trajectory.
The format of the top level object in the ﬂight ﬁles is described in Table 2 and its contained
types are described in Tables 3-11. Fig. 1 shows three example visualizations where the trajectories of ﬂights in Swedish airspace from different dates are illustrated.
In each archive there is also one ﬁle named airspace.json that contains coordinates for all
named points as well as all the extents of the control sectors for each of the centers. The format
of the airspace ﬁle is described in Table 12. The airspace is valid for the entire week of data
since the dates was chosen such that there were no conﬁguration changes.
Finally, each archive contains one ﬁle named grib_meteo.json. The contents in this ﬁle are
wind and temperature predictions used by the air traﬃc control system. This data originates
from World Meteorological Organization (WMO) in London. Predictions are made every third

3. Experimental Design, Materials and Methods
3.1. Data Sources
The data in the SCAT dataset originate from the air traﬃc control system TopSky [1], used for
area control in Swedish airspace. TopSky continuously records various system data and technical
logs, and stores it for up to three months. To store data for longer periods LFV uses KOOPA,
a system developed in-house, that collects and stores the data in its original proprietary raw
format. KOOPA also parses and stores the most commonly used data in a database to make
it more accessible. Most data in the this dataset was extracted from this database except for
trajectory predictions, weather data and some additional ﬁelds in the surveillance data that was
extracted from the raw data. Since there are no standard formats suitable for the data in this
dataset it was transformed into JSON.

3.2. Data Selection
The data was extracted in continuous one week time-blocks to capture the variation between
weekdays as well as variations due to the time of day. To capture seasonal variations in weather
conditions and traﬃc ﬂow, the extracted weeks were e spread as evenly as possible over one
year, see Table 1. The time periods were select with the following limitations in mind:
• To get a representative traﬃc sample we avoided to sample data from any time period with
events that had a major impact on the traﬃc patterns, such as ash clouds from volcanoes or
pandemics.
• To keep the data consistent we avoided any year with an update of the air traﬃc control
systems that changed the format and/or content of the data.
• Any weeks with system conﬁguration changes or system downtime due to maintenance were
avoided in order to get continuous data with a single airspace conﬁguration.

4. Data Extraction and Processing
For each selected week, all ﬂight plans and radar plots, for public ﬂights (see Data ﬁltration
below) passing Swedish airspace, were extracted from the KOOPA database using the individual
ﬂight plan identity code (IFPLID) as a unique identiﬁer. Since both centers (ESMM and ESOS)

10

J. Nilsson and J. Unger / Data in Brief 48 (2023) 109240

track information on ﬂights outside their respective control area many ﬂights were represented
in the data from both centers. In order to avoid duplication of information for each ﬂight with
various levels of completeness and correctness, only the data from the most relevant center were
kept at all points in time. For ﬂights controlled by both centers, a transition time was calculated
as the average time of when control was released from the ﬁrst center to the time when control
was assumed by the second center. Data with time stamps before the transition time were then
extracted from the ﬁrst center in control, and the data with time stamps after the transition time
from the second center. The average time was selected as a reasonable time stamp for hand-over
for ﬂights not traveling directly from the ﬁrst center to the other, e.g., for example ﬂights passing
through uncontrolled or foreign airspace in between the centers. Trajectory prediction data and
additional surveillance data (I062/380 Aircraft derived data) for each ﬂight were then extracted
from the raw data in KOOPA. As a last step airspace data and weather data were extracted.

4.1. Data Filtration
Due to regulations, LFV may only publish data on scheduled commercial ﬂights not involved
in any investigation or emergency, and the data in this dataset have been ﬁltered accordingly.
For example military and other state ﬂights as well as general aviation (private ﬂights) have
been removed. Any publication of surveillance data (radar plots) outside of Swedish airspace
are also prohibited and were therefore ﬁltered out. A small number of the remaining ﬂights
were removed for other reasons. Flights missing an IFPLID were removed since this information
is required in order to correlate ﬂights between the two centers. Flights crossing the boundary
between ESMM and ESOS more than once were removed since manual efforts would be required
to sort out the most relevant data for each data type. Finally, ﬂights that had a radar track of
less than 30 s in Swedish airspace were removed since they were not regarded as useful.

4.2. Data Validation
As a ﬁrst step, this dataset was validated during the extraction by logging values and comparing to the expected boundaries for applicable ﬁelds, out of bounds values were manually
compared with the content in the original data. After the extraction, the data were compared
to the content in the KOOPA database using a separate software that loaded each JSON ﬁle and
compared its content with the database. Manual validation was performed on 100 randomly selected ﬂights from each week of data, in total 1300 ﬂights, by converting the data to KML and
visually inspecting the content using Google Earth. As ﬁnal step of validation we have developed
a visualization tool in which we load the data and can visualize its different properties. Using
the visualization tool the structure and integrity of the dataset has been validated by ocular
inspection and ﬁltering such that different aspects of the data can be checked for inconsistencies and errors. The data collected by KOOPA is validated by LFV as part of the normal system
maintenance.
Even though this dataset has been subjected to extensive validation, it is important to realize
that the original raw data is not free from errors. For example there are sometimes errors in the
ﬂight plans that are corrected by the air traﬃc controllers if and when they are detected. Air
traﬃc controllers may make mistakes when entering values into the system or use the system
in such a way that a clearance does not correspond to what actually is happening. Pilots also
make mistakes and do not always not ﬂy according to given clearances. No effort was made to
identify, ﬁlter out or correct any such errors in this dataset since it is a part of normal operation,
and removal of such errors would impede the analysis of realistic scenarios.
